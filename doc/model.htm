<h1> Surface models. </h1>

The Surface Evolver can handle several different models of 
surfaces.  In fact, there are several different categories
of models regarding different features, so 
one variety of each category is active.  However, some combinations are
<a href="#incompatible models">incompatible</a>.

<a name="incompatible models"></a><h2>Incompatible models</h2>
The following combinations of <a href="#models">surface models</a>
are incompatible:
<ul>
<li> <a href="#simplex model">Simplex model</a> and 
<a href="#torus model">torus model</a> or other <a href="#symmetry groups">
symmetry group</a>.   This is because the simplex model does not have
the necessary edges to carry the symmetry wraps.
</ul>
<hr>
<hr>
<a name="combinatorics"></a><h2>Surface representation and combinatorics
</h2>
All surfaces are simplicial complexes made of the basic elements:
vertices, edges, and facets.
The Evolver has three different ways of representing the combinatorics
of the surface, depending on the dimension of the surface.  Any of these
may be used in any ambient space dimension at least as great at
 the surface dimension.
<menu>
<li><a href="#string model">String model</a> for dimension 1 surface.
<li><a href="#soapfilm model">Soapfilm model</a> (default) for dimension 2 surface.
<li><a href="#simplex model">Simplex model</a> for dimension 3 or higher surface.
</menu>

<hr>
<a name="string model"></a><h2>String model</h2>
The term "string model" means that the surface is one-dimensional.
The datafile must have the keyword "STRING" or "SURFACE_DIMENSION 1" 
in its top section.
Edges are defined in terms of their vertices, and facets by a list 
of boundary edges.
Facets are not divided into triangles, and may have any number of edges.  
The edges of a facet need not form a closed loop, for example if the
facet is partly bounded by a constraint.
A body is defined by associating one facet to it, and
the volume of the body is the area of the facet.
The default energy is edge length.  
<hr>
<a name="soapfilm model"></a><h2>Soapfilm model</h2>
The term "soapfilm model" means that the dimension of the surface is 2.
This is the default model. The surface is subdivided into triangular
facets, and the default energy is surface area.  Edges are defined
by their vertices. Facets are defined by an oriented list of three edges, which
must form a closed loop.  However, faces in the datafile may have more
than three edges, since they are automatically refined into facets when
loaded.  In official Evolver-speak, a "face" is what appears in the
datafile, and a "facet" is the triangle in the internal Evolver representation
of the surface.
Bodies are defined by a set of oriented facets, which need not form the
complete boundary of the body, for example if part of the boundary is
on a constraint.
<p>
Internally, the surface is held together by a set of structures called
"facet-edges".  There is one such structure for each incidence of an
edge on a facet.  There is a doubly linked list of facet-edges around each
facet, so edges can be traversed in order, and there is a doubly-linked
list around each edge, so the facets around an edge can be traversed
in geometric order.  Evolver figures out the geometric order from the
geometric data in the datafile.  If geometric order does not make sense,
as when the space dimension is 4 or more, then the order is random.
<hr>
<a name="simplex model"></a><h2>Simplex model</h2>


The simplex model enables the representation of arbitrary dimension surfaces,
but many Evolver features are not available with it. 
 Here each facet
is represented as an oriented list of k+1 vertices, where k is
the dimension of the surface.  Edges may be specified as k-1 dimensional
simplices, but they are used only to compute constraint and named
quantity integrals; a
complete list of edges is not needed.
Bodies are specified as lists of oriented facets.
<p>
The datafile must have the keyword  SIMPLEX_REPRESENTATION in
the top section, and the phrase  'SURFACE_DIMENSION k' if k isn't 2.
k = 1 and k = 2 are allowed, but not very useful in comparison to
the <a href="#string model">string</a> or <a href="#soapfilm model">
soapfilm</a> models.
If the  domain is not 3-dimensional, then 'SPACE_DIMENSION n'
must also be included.
The  datafile edges section is optional.  Each
facet should list k+1 vertex numbers.  Non-simplicial facets are
not allowed. See the sample datafile simplex3.fe.
<p>
Most features are not implemented.
The <a href="#quadratic model">quadratic model</a> is not allowed,
but the <a href="#Lagrange model">Lagrange model</a> is.
 Vertices may be FIXED.
Constraints are allowed, with energy integrands.
Several basic named quantity methods work.
No <a href="#torus model">torus model</a>
 or <a href="#symmetry groups">symmetry groups</a>.
No changing of surface topology or combinatorics is allowed except
global refining with the
<a href="single.htm#r">r</a> command.
Refining subdivides each simplex 1-edge, with the edge midpoint
inheriting the common attributes of the edge endpoints.
Refining will increase the number of facets by
a factor of 2^k.
<hr>
<hr>

<a name="element representation"></a><h2>Representation of surface elements</h2>
A surface is represented by a finite element method, where each element
is a simplex.  The simplest types of elements are just straight line segments
and flat triangles.  These combine to represent a piecewise linear surface,
for which calculated quantities generally have an error of order h^2 compared
to the ideal smooth surface, where h is the linear size of an element.
Various ways of representing more accurate curved elements exist, and
Evolver implements a couple of versions of what are called "Lagrange elements".
<menu>
<li><a href="#linear model">Linear model</a> (default)
<li><a href="#quadratic model">Quadratic model</a>
<li><a href="#Lagrange model">Lagrange model</a>
</menu>
<hr>
<a name="linear model"></a><h2>Linear model</h2>
In the linear model, all edges and triangular facets are flat
line segments and triangles, respectively.  For all calculations,
an edge is defined by
its two endpoints, and a facet (in the <a href="#soapfilm model">
soapfilm model</a>) is defined by its three vertices.  This is the 
default.  Quadratic or Lagrange models may be changed to linear
with the <a href="single.htm#M">M 1</a> or <a href="commands.htm#linear">
linear</a> commands.  An exception is if the 
<a href="quants.htm#spherical_arc_length">spherical_arc_length</a>
method is used for <a href="datafile.htm#length_method_name">length_method_name
</a> in the  <a href="#string model">string model</a>, in which case edges 
are computed and drawn on a sphere centered at the origin.
 
<hr>
<a name="quadratic model"></a><h2>Quadratic model</h2> 

          By default, edges and facets are linear.  But it is possible
          to represent edges as quadratic curves and facets as
          quadratic patches by using the quadratic model.
          Each edge is endowed with a midpoint vertex.
          Most features are implemented for the quadratic representation,
          but some named quantity methods are not available, such as
          those involving curvature.
<p>
  A special case is circular arc mode, which is effective in quadratic mode
in the string model with  the <a href="quants.htm#circular_arc_length">
circular_arc_length</a> method used for 
<a href="datafile.htm#length_method_name">length_method_name</a>.
Then edges are calculated and drawn as exact circular arcs through
their three vertices.
<p> The smoothness of graphing of curved quadratic edges can be
controlled with the internal variable 
<a href="syntax.htm#string_curve_tolerance"><tt>string_curve_tolerance</tt></a>,
which is the desired angle in degrees between successive graphed segments
making up the edge.
<p>
 The quadratic model can be invoked by putting the 
<a href="datafile.htm#quadratic decl">QUADRATIC</a> keyword
          in the top section of the datafile or 
      by using the <a href="commands.htm#quadratic">quadratic</a> or 
          <a href="single.htm#M">M 2</a> commands.  
<hr>
<a name="Lagrange model"></a><h2>Lagrange model</h2>
The Evolver has a very limited implementation of higher-order
elements.  In the Lagrange model of order n, each edge is defined
by interpolation on n+1 vertices evenly spaced in the parameter 
domain, and each facet is defined by interpolation on (n+1)(n+2)/2
vertices evenly spaced in a triangular pattern in the parameter
domain.  That is, the elements are Lagrange elements in the terminology
of finite element analysis.
<p>
The Lagrange model is defined only for 
<a href="quants.htm">named quantities and methods</a>,
so Evolver will automatically do 
<a href="toggle.htm#convert_to_quantities">
<tt>convert_to_quantities</tt></a> when you invoke the Lagrange model.  
The methods that currently accept the Lagrange model are
<ul>
<li> <a href="quants.htm#vertex_scalar_integral">vertex_scalar_integral</a>
<li> <a href="quants.htm#edge_length">edge_length</a>
<li> <a href="quants.htm#edge_area">edge_area</a>
<li> <a href="quants.htm#edge_scalar_integral">edge_scalar_integral</a>
<li> <a href="quants.htm#edge_vector_integral">edge_vector_integral</a>
<li> <a href="quants.htm#edge_general_integral">edge_general_integral</a>
<li> <a href="quants.htm#facet_area">facet_area</a>
<li> <a href="quants.htm#facet_volume">facet_volume</a>
<li> <a href="quants.htm#facet_vector_integral">facet_vector_integral</a>
<li> <a href="quants.htm#facet_scalar_integral">facet_scalar_integral</a>
<li> <a href="quants.htm#facet_general_integral">facet_general_integral</a>
</ul>
  A surface may be converted to an order n
Lagrange model with the command "lagrange n".  This will convert
<a href="model.htm#linear model">linear</a>
 or <a href="model.htm#quadratic model">quadratic models</a>
 to Lagrange, and will convert between
different order Lagrange models. The commands
<a href="commands.htm#linear">linear</a> and 
<a href="commands.htm#quadratic">quadratic</a> will
convert Lagrange model back to the linear or quadratic models.
<p>
No triangulation manipulations are available in the Lagrange model.
No refining, equiangulation, or anything.  There is some vertex averaging, 
but just internal to edges and facets.    Use the linear or
quadratic model to establish your final triangulation, and just use
the Lagrange model to get extra precision.
<p>
The current order can be accessed through the read-only internal
variable <a href="syntax.htm#lagrange_order">lagrange_order</a>.
The Lagrange model can be <a href="commands.htm#dump">dumped</a> and reloaded.
<p>
As the Lagrange order is raised, calculations slow down rapidly.
This is not only due to the large number of points involved, but is
also due to the fact that the order of Gaussian integration is also
raised.
<p>
Lagrange elements are normally plotted subdivided on their
vertices, but if the <a href="toggle.htm#smooth_graph">smooth_graph</a>
 flag is on, they are plotted with 8-fold subdivision.
<p> 
The toggle command <a href="toggle.htm#bezier_basis">bezier_basis</a>
toggle replaces the Lagrange interpolation polynomials (which pass through
the control points) with Bezier basis polynomials (which do not pass
through interior control points, but have positive values, which guarantees
the edge or facet is within the convex hull of the control points).
This is experimental at the moment, and not all features such as 
graphing or refinement have been suitably adjusted.

<a name="space dimension"></a><h2>Space dimension</h2>
<a name="MAXCOORD"></a>

      By default, surfaces live in 3 dimensional space.  However,
      the phrase "SPACE_DIMENSION n" in the datafile header sets the
      dimension to n.  This means that all coordinates and vectors
      have n components.  The only restriction is that Evolver has
      to be compiled with the MAXCOORD macro defined to be 
      at least n 
in Makefile or in  model.h.  The default MAXCOORD is 4. Change MAXCOORD
and recompile if you want more than four dimensions.  The actual space
dimension can be accessed in commands through the read-only variable
<a href="syntax.htm#space_dimension">space_dimension</a>.

       Graphics will display only the first three dimensions of spaces
       with more than three dimensions, except for geomview, which
       has a four-dimensional viewer built in (although its use is
       awkward now).
<hr>
<hr>
<a name="metric"></a><h2>Metric</h2>
For length and area to make sense, the ambient space must be endowed
with a metric.  The Evolver offers several choices, but keep in mind
that they are only used to calculate default length and area.  Other
quantities that depend on the metric, such as volume, are up to the
user to put in by hand with <a href="quants.htm">named quantities</a>. 
 All displaying is done as if the metric is Euclidean.
<menu>
<li><a href="#Euclidean metric">Euclidean metric</a> (default)
<li><a href="#Riemannian metric">Riemannian metric</a>
<li><a href="#conformal metric">Conformal metric</a>
<li><a href="#Klein hyperbolic metric">Klein hyperbolic metric</a>
</menu>
<hr>
<a name="Euclidean metric"></a> <h2>Euclidean metric</h2>
The default metric on the ambient space is the ordinary Euclidean
metric.  There are no built-in units of measurement like meters
or grams, so the user should express all physical quantities in some
consistent system of units, such as MKS or cgs.
<hr>
<a name="Riemannian metric"></a><h2>Riemannian metric</h2>

         The ambient space can be endowed with a general Riemannian metric
         by putting the keyword  METRIC 
          in the <a href="datafile.htm#metric decl">datafile</a> followed
         by the elements of the metric tensor. 
         Only one coordinate
         patch is allowed, but the <a href="#quotient spaces">quotient space</a>
      feature makes this
         quite flexible.  Edges and facets are linear in coordinates,
         they are not geodesic.  The metric is used solely to calculate
         lengths and areas.  It is not used for volume.  To get a volume
         constraint on a body, you will have to define your own
         <a href="quants.htm#fixed quantity">named quantity constraint</a>.
 See quadm.fe for an example of a metric.
<hr>
<a name="conformal metric"></a><h2>Conformal metric</h2>
         The ambient space can be endowed with a conformal Riemannian metric
         by putting the keyword CONFORMAL_METRIC
          in the <a href="datafile.htm#metric decl">datafile</a> followed
         by a formula for the conformal factor, i.e. the 
         multiple of the identity matrix that gives the metric.
         Only one coordinate
         patch is allowed, but the quotient space feature makes this
         quite flexible.  Edges and facets are linear in coordinates,
         they are not geodesic.  The metric is used solely to calculate
         lengths and areas.  It is not used for volume.  To get a volume
         constraint on a body, you will have to define your own
         <a href="quants.htm#fixed quantity">named quantity constraint</a>.
         See quadm.fe for an example of a metric.
<hr>
<a name="Klein hyperbolic metric"></a><h2>Klein hyperbolic metric</h2>
         One special metric is available built-in.  It is the Klein
	 model of hyperbolic space in n dimensions.  The domain is
	 the unit disk or sphere in Euclidean coordinates.  Including
	 the keyword  KLEIN_METRIC in the top section of the 
	 datafile will invoke this metric.  Lengths and areas are
	 calculated exactly, but as with other metrics you are on your
	 own for volumes and quantities. 

<hr>
<hr>
<a name="symmetries"></a><h2>Symmetries</h2>
         There are many interesting problems dealing with symmetric
         surfaces.  A natural way to deal with a symmetric surface is
 to compute with only one fundamental domain of the symmetry, and use
special boundary conditions.  Some symmetries, such as mirror symmetries,
can be handled with normal Evolver features.  For example, a mirror
can be implemented as a planar level set constraint.  But symmetries
such as translational or rotational symmetry require some built-in
features.  In any case, multiple copies of the fundamental domain may be displayed
with the <a href="datafile.htm#view transforms">view_transforms</a> command.
<menu>
<li><a href="#default symmetry">No symmetry</a> (default)
<li><a href="#torus model">Torus model</a>  (translational symmetry)
<li><a href="#symmetry groups">Symmetry groups</a> (general symmetry)
</menu>
<hr>
<a name="default symmetry"></a><h2>No symmetry</h2>

         By default, the domain of a surface is Euclidean space.
A symmetric surface can be done this way if its fundamental domain
is bounded by mirror planes.  Each mirror plane should be implemented
as a linear level set constraint.
<hr>
<a name="torus model"></a> <h2>Torus model</h2>

The Evolver can take as its domain
         a flat torus with an arbitrary parallelpiped as its unit
         cell, i.e. the domain is a parallelpiped with its opposite
         faces identified.  This is indicated by the 
         <a href="datafile.htm#torus declaration">TORUS</a> keyword
         in the datafile. The defining basis vectors of the parallelpiped
         are given  in the 
         <a href="datafile.htm#torus periods">TORUS_PERIODS</a>
          entry of the datafile.
	 See  <a href="twointor.htm">twointor.fe</a> for an example.
<p>
         Vertex coordinates are given as Euclidean coordinates
         within the unit cell, not as linear combinations of
         the period vectors.  The coordinates need not lie within
         the parallelpiped, as the exact shape of the unit cell
         is somewhat arbitrary. 
<p>
          The way the surface wraps around in the torus
         is given by saying how the edges cross the faces of the
         unit cell.  In the datafile
         <a href="datafile.htm#edges section">edges section</a>,
          each edge has one symbol per dimension
         indicating how the edge vector crosses each identified pair of faces,
         and how the vector between the endpoints needs to be
         adjusted to get the true edge vector:
<table>
<tr> <td> * </td><td> does not cross face </td></tr>
<tr> <td> + </td><td> crosses in same direction as basis vector, 
                           so basis vector added to edge vector </td></tr> 
<tr> <td> - </td><td> crosses in opposite direction, so basis 
                           vector subtracted from edge vector. </td></tr>
</table>
     Wraps are automatically maintained  by the various
     triangulation manipulation operations.
     <p>
<a name="torus display"></a>
         There are several commands for ways of displaying a torus surface:<br>
<a href="toggle.htm#raw_cells">raw_cells</a>
 - Graph the facets as they are, without clipping.  The
   first vertex of a  facet is used as the basepoint for any unwrapping
of other vertices needed.
                 <br>
<a href="toggle.htm#connected">connected</a>  - Each body's facets are unwrapped
                 in the torus, so the body appears in one connected
                 piece.  Nicest option, but won't show facets not on bodies. <br>
<a href="toggle.htm#clipped">clipped</a> - Shows the unit cell specified in the
                 datafile.  Facets are clipped on the parallelpiped
                 faces.  
<p>
         A few features are not available with the torus model,
         such as gravity and the simplex model.  (Actually,
         you could put them in, but they will not take into account
         the torus model.) 
<p>
         Volumes and volume constraints are available.  However,
         if the torus is completely partitioned into bodies of
         prescribed volume, then the volumes must add up to the
         volume of the unit cell and the  TORUS_FILLED keyword
         must be given in the datafile.  Or just don't prescribe
	 the volume of one body. 
<p>
         Volumes are somewhat ambiguous. The volume calculation
         method is accurate only to one torus volume, so it is
         possible that a body whose volume is positive gets its
         volume calculated as negative.  Evolver adjusts volumes
         after changes to be as continuous as possible with the previous
         volumes as possible, or with target volumes when available.
         You can also set a body's volconst attribute if you don't
         like the Evolver's actions.

<p>
         <a href="constrnt.htm#level set constraints">Level set constraints</a>
	 can be used in the torus model,
	 but be cautious when using them as mirror symmetry planes
	 with volumes.  The torus volume algorithm does not cope
	 well with such partial surfaces.  If you must, then
	 use y=const symmetry planes rather than x=const, and
	 use the <a href="general.htm#options">-q option</a>
	 or do <a href="toggle.htm#convert_to_quantities">
	 <b>convert_to_quantities</b></a>.  Double-check
	 that your volumes are turning out correctly; use volconst
	 if necessary.
<p>
<a name="display_periods"></a>
<b>Display_periods:</b> The displayed parallelogram unit cell can be 
different from the  actual unit cell if you 
put an array called <tt>display_periods</tt> in the top of the datafile,
in addition to the regular periods. For a string model example,
<pre>   parameter shear = 1
   torus_filled
   periods
   4  0
   shear  4
   display_periods
   4 0
   0 4 </pre>
This will always display a square, no matter how much the actual unit
cell is sheared.  This feature works well for shears; it may not work
nicely for other kinds of deformation.  Display_periods works better 
for the string model than the soapfilm model.  For the soapfilm model,
it seems to do horizontal shears best, but it can't cope with large shears,
so if your shear gets too large, I advise resetting your fundamental
region to less shear, say with the <tt>unshear</tt> command in 
<tt>unshear.cmd</tt>.
<p>
<b><a name="display_origin"> Display_origin: </a></b>
    For a torus mode surface,
if clipped mode is in effect, the center of the clip box is
set with the <tt>display_origin[]</tt> array whose dimension
 is the dimension of
the ambient space.  This array does not exist by default,
it has to be created by the user in the top of the datafile
with the syntax
<pre>
  display_origin <em>x y z</em>
</pre> where <em>x y z</em> are the coordinates for the
desired center of the clip box.  At runtime, the
array elements may be changed as normal:
<pre>  display_origin[2] := 0.5
</pre>
Changing display_origin will automatically cause the
graphics to re-display.

<a name="quotient spaces"></a>
<a name="symmetry groups"></a><h2>Symmetry groups and quotient spaces</h2>
         As a generalization of the 
         <a href="#torus model">torus model</a>, you may declare
         the domain to be the quotient space of R^n with respect to
         some symmetry group.  Several built-in groups are available,
         and ambitious users can compile C code into Evolver
         to define group operations.  Group elements are represented
         by integers attached to edges (like the wrap specifications
         in the torus model at runtime).  You define the integer representation
         of the group elements. See the file quotient.c
         for an example.  See  khyp.c and khyp.fe
	 for a more intricate example
	 modelling an octagon in Klein hyperbolic space identified into
	 a genus 2 surface.  
<p>
The datafile requires the keyword 
         <a href="datafile.htm#symmetry decl">SYMMETRY_GROUP</a>
          followed by the name for the group in quotes.
         Edges that wrap have their group element specified in the
         datafile by the phrase "wrap n", where n is the
         number of the group element.
	 The wrap values are accessible
	 at run time with the <tt>wrap</tt> attribute of edges.
         The group operations are accessible by the functions
    <tt>wrap_inverse(w)</tt> and <tt>wrap_compose( w1,w2)</tt>.

Using any Hessian commands with any symmetry group
(other than the built-in torus model) will cause automatic
converting to named quantities (with the 
"<a href="toggle.htm#convert_to_quantities">
convert_to_quantities</a>" command,
since only named quantity Hessian evaluation routines have the proper
symmetry transformation of the Hessian programmed in.

        Volumes of bodies might not be calculated correctly with a
         symmetry group.  The volume calculation only knows about
         the built-in torus model.  For other symmetry groups, if
         you declare a body, it will use the Euclidean volume 
         calculation.  It is up to you to design an alternate
         volume calculation using named quantities and methods.

The torus group is the group on <i>n</i>-dimensional Euclidean space

<b>Group element encoding:</b>
 The 32-bit code word is divided into 6-bit fields,
one field for the wrap in each dimension, with low bits for the first
dimension.  Hence the maximum space dimension is 5.
Within each bitfield, 1 codes for positive wrap and 011111
codes for negative wrap.  The coding is actually a 2's complement 5-bit integer,

<a name="mobility"></a><h2>Mobility</h2>

There is a choice to be made in the conversion of the forces on
vertices into velocities of vertices.  Technically, force is the
gradient of energy, hence a covector on the manifold of all
possible configurations. In the Evolver representations of
surfaces, that global covector
can be represented as a covector at each vertex.  The velocity
is a global vector, which is represented as a vector at each
vertex.  Conversion from the global covector to the global vector
requires multiplication by a metric tensor, i.e. singling out
a particular inner product on global vectors and covectors.
The tensor converting from force to velocity is the  mobility
tensor, represented as the  mobility matrix M in some
coordinate system.  Its inverse, converting
from velocity to force, is the resistance tensor
S = M^{-1}.  The same inner product has to be used in
projecting the velocity tangent to the constraints, whether
they be level set constraints on vertices or constraints on
body volumes or quantity integrals.
There are several choices implemented in the Evolver,
corresponding to several different physical pictures of how
the medium resists the motion of the surface through it:
<menu>
<li> <a href="#unit mobility">unit mobility</a>
<li> <a href="#area normalization">area normalization</a>
<li> area normalization with <a href="#effective area">effective area</a>
<li> <a href="#polyhedral curvature">approximate polyhedral curvature</a>
<li> <a href="#user-defined mobility">user-defined mobility</a>
</menu>
<hr>
<a name="unit mobility"></a>  <h2>Unit mobility</h2>

This is the default <a href="#mobility">mobility</a>, in which the velocity is equal to the
force.  Hence M and S are the identity matrices in standard
coordinates.  The physical interpretation of this is that there
is a  resistance to motion of each vertex through the medium
proportional to its velocity, but not for the edges.  This does
not approximate motion by mean curvature, but it is very easy
to calculate.
<hr>
<a name="area normalization"></a><h2>Area normalization</h2>
A type of  <a href="#mobility">mobility</a>.
In motion by mean curvature, the resistance to motion is really due
to the surfaces, not the vertices. One way to approximate this is
to say the resistance to motion of a vertex is proportional to
the area associated with the vertex.  So this scheme counts the
area of a vertex equal to 1/3 of the area of the star of 
facets around it (or 1/2 the area of the star of edges in the 
string model).  This is easy to calculate, since it is a local
calculation for each vertex. S and M are diagonal matrices
(see <a href="#mobility">mobility</a>).
The result is that motion = force/area, which is a much better
approximation to motion by mean curvature than the default
of motion = force.
Area normalization can be toggled with the
<a href="single.htm#a">a</a> command or the
<a href="toggle.htm#area_normalization">area_normalizaton</a> toggle.
<hr>
<a name="effective area"></a>  <h2> Area normalization with effective area</h2>

A type of  <a href="#mobility">mobility</a>.
Simple area normalization as described in the previous paragraph
isn't what's really wanted in certain circumstances.  It has
equal resistance for motion in all directions, both parallel and
normal to the surface.  If a vertex is a triple junction and 
migrating along the direction of one of the edges, it shouldn't
matter how long that edge is.  Therefore, if the effective area
mode is in effect, the area associated with a vertex is the
area of its star projected normal to the force at the vertex.
This is a little more complicated calculation, but it is still
local.  S and M are block diagonal matrices, with one
block for each vertex
(see <a href="#mobility">mobility</a>).
 At a free edge not on any constraint, the force is tangent
to the surface, the resistance is zero, and the mobility is
infinite.  But this accurately describes a popping soapfilm.
Effective area can be toggled with the <a href="toggle.htm#effective_area">
effective_area</a> toggle.  Note that area normalization itself must
still be toggled with <a href="single.htm#a">a</a> or 
<a href="toggle.htm#area_normalization">area_normalizaton</a>.
<hr>
<a name="polyhedral curvature"></a><h2> Approximate polyhedral curvature</h2>

A type of  <a href="#mobility">mobility</a>.
Following a suggestion of Gerhard Dzuik and Alfred Schmidt, the
inner product of global vectors is taken to be the integral of 
the scalar product of their linear interpolations over the facets
(or edges in the string model).  This has the advantage that
the rate of area decrease of the surface is equal to the rate
volume is swept out by the surface, which is a characteristic
of motion by mean curvature.  A big disadvantage is that the
matrices M and S are no longer local (see <a href="#mobility">mobility</a>).  
S is a sparse matrix with entries corresponding
to each pair of vertices joined by an edge, and M is its
dense inverse.  Approximate polyhedral curvature can be toggled with
the <a href="toggle.htm#approximate_curvature">approx_curv</a> toggle command.
<hr>
<a name="effective polyhedral"></a>
<h2> Approximate polyhedral curvature with effective area.
</h2>
<a href="#polyhedral curvature">Polyhedral curvature</a>
does not make any distinction between motion
parallel and perpendicular to the surface. A better approximation
is to count only motion perpendicular to the surface.  This can be
done by projecting the interpolated vectorfields normal to the
facets before integrating their scalar product.  Now the rate of 
area decrease is equal to the rate geometric volume is swept out,
as opposed to the slightly flaky way one had to calculate volume
sweeping in the previous paragraph.
Again S is a sparse matrix with entries corresponding
to each pair of vertices joined by an edge, and M is its
dense inverse.  The effective area option may be toggled with
<a href="toggle.htm#effective_area">effective_area</a>.
<hr>
<a name="user-defined mobility"></a><h2>User-defined mobility</h2>

The user may define a 
<a href="#mobility">mobility</a> tensor in the 
<a href="datafile.htm#mobility decl">datafile</a>.
There is a scalar form with the keyword MOBILITY and a tensor
form with MOBILITY_TENSOR.  When in effect, this mobility is 
multiplied times the velocity to give a new velocity.  This happens
after any of the previous mobilities of this section have been
applied and before projection to constraints.  The formulas defining
the mobility may include adjustable parameters, permitting the 
mobility to be adjusted during runtime.
The formulas are evaluated at each vertex at each iteration, and 
so formulas may depend on vertex position and any vertex attributes.
