<h1> Evolver datafile format </h1>

             The initial configuration of the surface is read
         from an ASCII datafile.  See the <a href="cube.htm">cube</a>
         or <a href="mound.htm">mound</a> examples for samples.
         The datafile is organized into six parts:
<ul>
         <li> <a href="#datafile header">Definitions and options</a>
         <li> <a href="#vertices section">Vertices</a>
         <li> <a href="#edges section">Edges</a>
         <li> <a href="#faces section">Faces</a>
         <li> <a href="#bodies section">Bodies</a>
         <li> <a href="#read section">Initial commands</a>
</ul>
General datafile topics:
<ul>
<li><a href="syntax.htm">General syntax </a> (for datafiles and commands)
<li><a href="#include files">Include files</a>
<li><a href="#macros">Macros</a>
</ul>
         In the syntax descriptions below, keywords will be in
         upper case.  <i>constexpr</i> means a constant expression,
         and <i>expr</i> means any expression. <i>n</i> or <i>k</i> means an integer,
         which may be signed if it is being used as an oriented
         element label.
         Square brackets denote optional items. '|' means 'or'.


<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Usually a formula can occur anyplace a number is legal (except 
element numbers, constraint numbers, etc).  Some formulas are stored as
formulas and re-evaluated at each use; examples include constraint, 
boundary, and quantity formulas.  Others, such as vertex coordinates,
are evaluated when the datafile is read, and only the numeric value stored.  
Thus if a user defines a vertex coordinate as <tt>3*width</tt>, then
changing the value of the variable <tt>width</tt> at runtime will not
affect the vertex.  If you are not clear on which interpretation applies in
a certain spot, <a href="commands.htm#dump">dump</a> the datafile and
look at the spot to see if a formula or number was dumped.
<hr>
<a name="include files"></a><h2>Include files</h2>
	The standard C language method of including other files is
	available.  The file name must be in double quotes.  If the file is
	not in the current directory, 
<a href="install.htm#EVOLVERPATH">EVOLVERPATH</a> will be searched.
	Includes may be nested to 10 deep.
	Example:<pre>
	#include  "common.stuff"
</pre>
<hr>
<a name="macros"></a><h2>Macros</h2>
Macros are text substitutions done by replacing an identifier by
a string of characters before parsing.  Macros are only defined
in the datafile, and do not work from the command prompt.
         Simple macros (no parameters) may be defined as in C:
<pre>         #DEFINE  <em>identifier  string</em>
</pre>
       <em>identifier</em> must be an identifier without 
         other special meaning to the parser.
         <em>string</em> is the rest of the logical line, not including
         comments.  It will be
         substituted for <em>identifier</em> whenever <em>identifier</em> occurs as a token
         subsequently.  Substitutions are re-scanned.  No checks
         for recursiveness are made.  There is a maximum length
         (currently 500 characters) on a macro definition. Note: macro
         identifiers are separate tokens, so if "-M" translates
         into "-2", this will be read as two tokens, not a signed number.
<a name="keep_macros"></a>
        The keyword <tt>keep_macros</tt> in the datafile will keep macro
         definitions active during runtime, until the next datafile is
         loaded.


<hr>
<hr>

<a name="datafile header"></a> <h2>Datafile top section</h2>

The datafile begins with optional definitions and specifications.
These are definitions that need to be made before the geometric
elements are defined, or for which command syntax is lacking or 
awkward.  Other initializations can be made at the
end of the datafile in the <a href="#read section">read</a> section
using the command language.
         Each line starts with a keyword.  The order is immaterial,
         except for the usual rule that items must be defined before use.
         None of these are required if you are willing to accept various
defaults.  They are listed here in rough order of frequency of use; those
in the first column you should know, those in the second column you might never
use in a lifetime.

<a name="datafile variables"></a><h2>Definitions of variables</h2>
Variables may be defined in the datafile top section with this syntax:
<pre>
      PARAMETER <em>identifier</em> = <em>constexpr</em>
</pre>
             This declares <em>identifier</em> to be a variable
              with the given initial value. The value may
              be changed at runtime with the 
<a href="single.htm#A">A</a> command, or by 
<a href="commands.htm#assignment">assignment</a>.  Variables
              may be used in any subsequent expression or constant expression.
	     Changing variables defined here
	     results in automatic recalculation of 
	     the surface when
<a href="toggle.htm#autorecalc">autorecalc</a> is been toggled on.
	     Hence only variables needed in other top section declarations
	     should be defined here.

<hr>
<a name="nonpositive"></a>
<a name="nonnegative"></a>
<a name="nonwall"></a>
<a name="constraint decl"></a><h2>Level set constraint declarations</h2>
The format for declaring a 
<a href="constrnt.htm#level set constraints">level set constraint</a>
 in the top section of the datafile is
<pre>
CONSTRAINT <em>n</em> [GLOBAL] [CONVEX] [NONNEGATIVE] [NONPOSITIVE] [NONWALL]
FORMULA FUNCTION  <em>expr</em>
[ENERGY:
 E1: <em>expr</em>
 E2: <em>expr</em>
 E3: <em>expr</em>]
[CONTENT:
 C1: <em>expr</em>
 C2: <em>expr</em>
 C3: <em>expr</em>]
</pre>
You may use <tt>EQUATION</tt> or <tt>FUNCTION</tt> as synonyms for <tt>FORMULA</tt>.
   This defines constraint number <em>n</em>, where <em>n</em> is a
   positive integer.  The optional
   keyword <tt>GLOBAL</tt> means the constraint automatically applies to all
   vertices (but not automatically to edges or faces).  <tt>GLOBAL</tt>
   constraints count in the number limit.  If <tt>CONVEX</tt> is given,
   then an additional <a href="energies.htm#gap energy">gap energy</a>
   is attributed to edges on the
   constraint to prevent them from trying to short-circuit a convex
   boundary.  <tt>NONWALL</tt> indicates this constraint is to be ignored
    in vertex and edge popping.
  If <tt>NONNEGATIVE</tt> or <tt>NONPOSITIVE</tt> is given, then this is
   a <a href="constrnt.htm#one-sided constraints">one-sided constraint</a>, and
  all vertices will be forced to conform appropriately to the
   constraint at each iteration.  The <tt>FORMULA</tt> expression defines
   the zero level set which is the actual constraint.  It may be
   written as an equation, since '=' is parsed as a low-precedence
   minus sign.  
              The formula may include any expressions whose values
                are known to the Evolver, given the particular vertex.
                Most commonly one just uses the coordinates (x,y,z) of the
                vertex, but one can use variables, quantity values,
                or vertex extra attributes.  Using a vertex extra
                attribute is a good way to customize one formula to
                individual vertices.  For example, if there were a
                vertex extra attribute called zfix, one could force
                vertices to individual z values with one constraint 
                with the formula z = zfix, after of course assigning
                proper values to zfix for each vertex (be sure to
fix up zfix after refining or otherwise creating vertices). 
    Do not use '&gt;' or '&lt;' to indicate inequalities; use
   <tt>NONNEGATIVE</tt> or <tt>NONPOSITIVE</tt>. 
   Conditional expressions, as in C
   language, are useful for defining constraints composed of several
   surfaces joined smoothly, such as a cylinder with hemispherical
   caps. Assignments to variables may be made at the start of expressions, mainly for
   the purpose of evaluating common subexpressions only once in 
   the integrands.  The syntax for such a compound expression is
<pre>
    variable :=  expr, expr
</pre>
   The value of the expression is the value of the second expression.

<p>               
   The optional <tt>ENERGY</tt> section signifies that vertices or edges on the
                constraint are deemed to have an energy.  
                In the 
<a href="model.htm#soapfilm model">soapfilm model</a>,
 the next lines give
                components of a vectorfield that will be integrated
                along each edge on the constraint.  In the 
<a href="model.htm#string model">string model</a>, 
just one component is needed, which is  
                evaluated at each vertex on the constraint.
                The main purpose of this is to permit facets
                entirely on the constraint to be omitted.  Any
                energy they would have had should be included here.
                One use is to get prescribed contact angles at
                a constraint.  This energy should also include
     <a href="energies.htm#gravity energy">gravitational potential energy</a>
 due to omitted facets.
		Integrals are now also evaluated on <tt>fixed</tt> edges, which
is a change from earlier versions of Evolver.
<p>
The optional <tt>CONTENT</tt> section signifies that vertices 
(<a href="model.htm#string model">string model</a> ) or
      edges (<a href="model.htm#soapfilm model">soapfilm model</a>) on the
                constraint contribute to the area or volume of bodies.
                If the part of a body boundary that is on a constraint
                is not defined by facets, then the body volume must
                get a contribution from a content integral.
	  It is important to understand how the content is added to the
	  body in order to get the signs right.  The integral is evaluated
	  along the positive direction of the edge. If the edge is positively
	  oriented on a facet, and the facet is positively oriented on a body,
	  then the integral is added to the body.  This may wind up giving
	  the opposite sign to the integrand from what you think may be natural.
	  Always check a new datafile when you load it to be sure the integrals
	  come out right.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="boundary decl"></a><h2>Parameterized boundary declaration</h2>
A parameterized boundary may be declared in the top section of the
datafile with the syntax
<pre>
BOUNDARY <em>n</em> PARAMETERS <em>k</em> [CONVEX] 
X1: <em>expr</em> 
X2: <em>expr</em>
X3: <em>expr</em>
</pre>

   This defines boundary number <em>n</em>, where <em>n</em> is a positive
   integer and <em>k</em> is the 
                number of parameters.  If <tt>CONVEX</tt> is
                given, then an additional 
<a href="energies.htm#gap energy">gap energy</a> is attributed to 
                edges on the boundary to prevent them from trying
                to short-circuit a convex boundary. 
The following lines have
                the functions for the coordinates in terms
                of the parameters <tt>P1</tt> and maybe <tt>P2</tt>, <tt>P3</tt>,....
See the <a href="catenoid.htm">catenoid example</a>.
  Energy and
                content integrals for boundaries are implemented, with 
		the same syntax as for <a href="#constraint decl">
		level set constraints</a>.


<hr><h2><a name="named quantity decl">Named quantities</a></h2>
<a name="lagrange_multiplier"></a>
The syntax for defining a  <a name="info_only"></a>
<a href="quants.htm#named quantities">named quantity</a> in the data file is:
<p><pre> QUANTITY <i>name</i>   ENERGY|FIXED=<i>value</i>|CONSERVED|INFO_ONLY [LAGRANGE_MULTIPLIER <i>constexpr</i>]
[TOLERANCE <i>constexpr</i>]  [MODULUS <i>constexpr</i>] <i>methodlist</i> | FUNCTION <i>methodexpr</i>
</pre>
<p>
Here <i>name</i> is an identifier assigned by the user in order
to refer to the quantity. 
Any quantities must be declared to be one of three types:
<ul>
<li><tt>ENERGY</tt> quantities are added to the overall
energy of the surface; 
<li><tt>FIXED</tt> quantities that are constrained to a
fixed target <i>value</i>;
<li><tt>CONSERVED</tt> quantities are like FIXED in that the motion is
projected to conserve the quantity, but the actual value is not projected
to a given value.
<li><tt>INFO_ONLY</tt> quantities whose values are merely reported to the user.
</ul>
For fixed quantities, the optional Lagrange multiplier value supplies
the initial value of the Lagrange multiplier (the "pressure" attribute
of the quantity).  It is meant for dump
files, so on reloading no iteration need be done to have a valid
Lagrange multiplier.
<p>
For fixed quantities, the tolerance attribute is used to judge convergence.
A surface is deemed converged when the sum of all ratios of quantity
discrepancies to tolerances is less than 1.  This sum also includes
bodies of fixed volume.  If the tolerance is not set or is negative, 
the value of
the variable target_tolerance is used, which has a default value of 0.0001.
<p>
Each quantity has a modulus, which is just a scalar multiplier of
the whole quantity. A modulus of 0 will turn off an energy quantity.
The default modulus is 1.

<a name="global_method"></a>
The <i>methodlist</i> version of the quantity definition may  
contain one or more <a href="quants.htm#method instances">method instances</a>. 
To incorporate a previously explicitly defined instance, include
<tt>METHOD</tt> <i>instancename</i>.  <tt>GLOBAL_METHOD</tt> may be used
instead of <tt>METHOD</tt> to indicate the method applies to all elements
of the appropriate type; it is equivalent to using <tt>GLOBAL</tt> in
the method definition.
To instantiate a method in the quantity definition, 
you essentially
incorporate the <a href="#method instance decl">instance definition</a>, 
but without an instance name.  Example of a quantity with one predefined
method instance and one implicitly defined instance:
<pre>   method_instance qwerty method facet_scalar_integral
     scalar_integrand: x^2
   quantity foobar energy method qwerty method edge_scalar_integral
     scalar_integrand: y^3
</pre>
<p>
Usually the second, implicit definition will be more convenient.
Several method instances may be included in one <i>methodlist</i>
(up to a current limit of 50), and their values are added together
and multiplied by the quantity modulus to get the quantity value.
The <tt>FUNCTION</tt> <i>methodexpr</i> variant
 defines the quantity as a function of 
previously defined method instances.  Example:
<pre>   method_instance qwerty method facet_scalar_integral
     scalar_integrand: x^2
   quantity foobar energy function qwerty^3
</pre>
<p>
Non-global quantities may
 be applied to elements individually by adding the quantity
name to the datafile line defining an element.  They
may also be applied or unapplied at runtime with the
<a href="commands.htm#set">set</a> and 
<a href="commands.htm#unset">unset</a> commands.
Orientable methods can be applied with negative orientation in the datafile by
following the name with a dash.  The orientation in a set command
follows the orientation the element is generated with.

<p>
Methods applying to different types of elements may be combined
in one quantity.
If such a quantity is applied to an element, then
all method instances of that quantity of the appropriate type are applied
to the element. Original attachments of quantities are remembered,
soIf an edge method is applied to a facet, then edges created from 
refining that facet will inherit the edge method.

<a name="method instance decl">Named method instances declaration</a></h2>
<a href="quants.htm#method instances">Method instances</a>
 are usually defined as part of the 
<a href="#named quantity decl">definition</a>
of a <a href="quants.htm#named quantities">named quantity</a>, 
but there are circumstances where a quantity
is composed of several method instances and the method instances
need to be referred to individually; perhaps the user wants to
know the values of the individual instances. 
The general syntax for defining an instance of a named method in
a datafile is:
<pre>  METHOD_INSTANCE <i>name</i> METHOD <i>methodname</i> [MODULUS <i>constexpr</i>] 
   [ELEMENT_MODULUS <i>attrname</i>]  [GLOBAL] [<i>parameters</i>]
</pre> 
Here, <i>name</i> is a user-assigned name for referring to this
particular instance. <i>methodname</i> is one of the 
<a href="quants.htm#methods">pre-defined methods</a> in Evolver.
The modulus value multiplies the method value to give the 
 instance value.  The default modulus is 1.
Individual elements may be given multipliers by specifying an
<a href="elements.htm#extra attributes">extra attribute</a>
<i>attrname</i> for the type of element; the attribute must have been
defined earlier.
 <tt>GLOBAL</tt> makes the method apply to all 
 elements of the appropriate type.  
Non-global instances may
 be applied to elements individually by adding the instance
name to the datafile line defining an element.  They
may also be applied or unapplied at runtime with the
<a href="commands.htm#set">set</a> and 
<a href="commands.htm#unset">unset</a> commands.
Orientable methods can be applied with negative orientation in the datafile by 
following the name with a dash.  The orientation in a set command
follows the orientation the element is generated with.
<p>
 Each method may have various parameters to specialize
 it to an instance.  Currently the only parameters  specified are:
<dl><dt> <tt>SCALAR_INTEGRAND: <i>expr</i> </tt></dt>
<dd> where <i>expr</i> is a scalar function of coordinates
(and of tangent or normal vector components in 
<a href="quants.htm#edge_general_integral">edge_general_integral</a>
or <a href="quants.htm#facet_general_integral">facet_general_integral</a>).
 Element attributes of the appropriate type

<a name="string"></a>
<a name="soapfilm"></a>
<a name="surface dimension decl"></a><h2>Surface dimension</h2>
The default dimension of the surface is 2.  If not, it must be declared in the 
top section of the datafile. For a 1-dimensional surface (the
<a href="model.htm#string model">string model</a>), simply include the line
<pre> STRING
</pre>
The default dimension 2 <a href="model.htm#soapfilm model">soapfilm model</a>
is equivalent to using
<pre> SOAPFILM
</pre>
In general, the line   
<pre> SURFACE_DIMENSION <i>n</i>
</pre>
defines the surface to have dimension <i>n</i>.
 Dimension over 2 is valid only in the 
<a href="model.htm#simplex model">simplex model</a>.
The surface dimension may be accessed at runtime through the read-only variable 
<a href="syntax.htm#surface_dimension">surface_dimension</a>.

<hr>
<a name="space dimension decl"></a><h2>Space dimension</h2>
The default dimension of space is 3. Otherwise it must be declared
in the top section of the datafile, with syntax
<pre>SPACE_DIMENSION <em>n</em>
</pre>
The dimension must be at most the value of MAXCOORD in
model.h, which is 4 in the distributed version.  
The space dimension may be accessed at runtime through the read-only variable 
<a href="syntax.htm#space_dimension">space_dimension</a>.

<hr>
<a name="extra decl"></a><h2>Extra attribute declarations</h2>
<a name="integer"></a>
<a name="real"></a>
<a name="ulong"></a>
<a name="self"></a>
It is possible for the user to define 
<a href="elements.htm#extra attributes">extra attributes</a> for elements,
which may be single values or up to eight-dimensional arrays.
  If these attributes are to
be included in the datafile, then the top section of the datafile
must contain appropriate definitions.  The definition syntax is
the same as used by the <a href="commands.htm#define">define</a> runtime
command:
<pre> DEFINE <em>elementtype</em> ATTRIBUTE <em>name</em> <em>type</em> [<em>dim</em>]...
</pre>
where <em>elementtype</em> is  <tt>vertex</tt>, <tt>edge</tt>, <tt>facet</tt>,
 or <tt>body</tt>, <em>name</em>
is an identifier of your choice, <em>type</em> is <tt>REAL</tt> or
<tt>INTEGER</tt>  (internally, there is also a <tt>ULONG</tt> unsigned
long type also),
and <em>dim</em> is an optional expression
for the vector dimension.  There is no practical distinction between real
and integer types at the moment, since everything is stored internally
as reals.  But there may be more datatypes added in the future.
Extra attributes are inherited by elements of the same type generated
by subdivision.
The <em>type</em> may be followed by <tt>FUNCTION</tt>
 followed by a procedure in brackets to be
evaluated whenever the value of the attribute is read; in the formula,
<tt>self</tt> may be used to refer to the element in question to use its
attributes, in particular to at some point assign a value to the attribute.
The <a href="commands.htm#print">print</a> command may be used to print
attribute arrays or array slices in bracketed form.
 Examples:
<pre>  define edge attribute charlie real 
  define vertex attribute oldx real[3] 
  define facet attribute knots real[5][5][5] 
  define edge attribute bbb real function { self.bbb := self.x+self.y }
</pre>
WARNING: there is a syntax ambiguity if you mean to define a stand-alone

include in the top section of the datafile the line
<pre>
TORUS
</pre>
All space dimensions will be periodic, with the period vectors given

<a name="torus periods"></a><h2>Torus periods</h2>
If periodic boundary conditions are used
(the <a href="model.htm#torus model">torus model</a>) ,
the period vectors of the fundamental unit cell parallelpiped
may be defined in the top section of the datafile. Default is the unit cube. 
The syntax
is the keyword <tt>PERIODS</tt> followed by expressions for the components
of each period vector:
<pre>PERIODS 
<em>expr expr expr</em>
<em>expr expr expr</em>

The size of this matrix depends on the space dimension.  
		 Variables may be used in the expressions,

</pre>
The matrix is in homogeneous
 coordinates with translations in the last column.
 The size of the matrix is one more than the space dimension.
 This matrix will be part of all dump files, so the view
 can be saved between sessions.  This matrix is used and set
 by native screen graphics ('s' command) and only applies
 to internal graphics (Postscript, Xwindows, etc.) but
 not external graphics (geomview).  The elements may be
 read or set at runtime by <tt>view_matrix[i][j]</tt>, where
 the indices start at 1.  In particular, one can write
 command scripts to save and reload particular view matrices;

<a name="view transforms"></a> <h2>View transforms</h2>
  For the display of several transformations of the surface

COLOR <em>color</em>
SWAP_COLORS
<em>  constexpr constexpr constexpr constexpr</em>
<em>  constexpr constexpr constexpr constexpr</em>

     The transforms apply to all graphics, internal
   and external, and are prior to the  
<a href="graphics.htm#view matrix">viewing matrix</a> for internal graphics. 
   The identity transform is always done, so
   it does not need to be specified. 
 The number of matrices
   follows the keyword <tt>VIEW_TRANSFORMS</tt>.  Each matrix is
   in homogeneous coordinates, with translation in the last column. 
   The size of each matrix is one more than the space dimension.
   Individual matrices need no
   special separation; Evolver just goes on an expression reading
   frenzy until it has all the numbers it wants.  Each matrix may
   be preceded by an optional <a href="syntax.htm#colors">color</a>
 that applies to facets transformed
   by that matrix. The color applies to one transform only; it does not
   continue until the next color specification.
  If SWAP_COLORS is present instead, facet frontcolor and backcolor will be
   swapped when this matrix is applied. Transforms may
   be activated or deactivated interactively 
   with the 
<a href="toggle.htm#transforms">transforms</a> toggle.
    The internal variable <tt>transform_count</tt> records the number
    of transforms, and
   the transform matrices are accessible at runtime as a three-dimensional
   matrix view_transforms[][][].
   <a href="#view generators">View transform generators</a> are

  Listing all the <a href="#view transforms">view transforms</a> is tedious

  instructions on entering the expression that generates the actual
  transforms. Special Note: in the <a href="model.htm#torus model">torus model</a>,
 the period translations
  are automatically added to the end of the list. So in the torus model,
  these are always available, even if you don't have 
  view_transform_generators in the datafile.  Syntax in the top of
  the datafile:
<pre>
VIEW_TRANSFORM_GENERATORS <em>n</em>

<hr>
<a name="scale_limit"></a><h2>Scale limit</h2>
To set an upper bound of <i>value</i>on the gradient descent
<a href="iterate.htm#scale factor">scale factor</a>,
include the line
<pre>
   SCALE_LIMIT <i>value</i>
</pre>
in the top section of the datafile.  The upper bound can be changed
at runtime with the <a href="single.htm#m">m</a> command, or by
setting the <tt>scale_limit</tt> variable.  If surface tension is
the main energy, the scale_limit should be set to the inverse of
the surface tension.

<a name="functions"></a><h2>Functions and procedures</h2>
Usually stand-alone user-defined 
<a href="commands.htm#function definition">functions</a> 
and 
<a href="commands.htm#procedure definition">procedures</a> 
are defined
in the <a href="datafile.htm#read section">read section</a> of the
datafile, but sometimes it is necessary to define them in the top section
of the datafile so they may be used in other top section declarations.
It is possible to define them in the top section with the same syntax
as in the read section.  Note this applies to the parameter-passing
variety of functions and procedures, denoted by the leading keyword
"function" or "procedure", and not command definitions like "gg := {...}".
WARNING: there is a syntax ambiguity if you mean to define a stand-alone
function in the top of the datafile and put it after an attribute 
declaration.  You should define stand-alone functions before attributes,
or separate them with some other kind of declaration.

<a name="optimizing_parameter"></a><h2>Optimizing parameter</h2>
<a name="optimising_parameter"></a>
<a name="pdelta"></a>

<a name="parameter scale"></a>
A variable may be made subject to optimization during 
<a href="iterate.htm#iteration step">iteration</a>
or <a href="commands.htm#hessian command">hessian</a> commands
with the datafile declaration
<pre>
      OPTIMIZING_PARAMETER <em>identifier</em> = <em>constexpr</em> PDELTA = <em>constexpr</em> PSCALE = <em>constexpr</em>
</pre>
Such a variable joins the vertex coordinates as an independent variable
during optimization.  However, it differs from a coordinate in that
gradients with respect to it are calculated numerically,
rather than analytically.  Thus it may be used anywhere a variable is 
permitted.  Hessians with optimizing parameters are 
implemented. The optional pdelta value is the parameter
difference to use in finite differences; the default value is 0.0001.
The optional pscale value is a multiplier for the parameter's motion,
to do "impedance matching" of the parameter to the surface energy.
These attributes may be set on any parameter, for potential use
as an optimizing parameter.
At runtime, a parameter may be toggled to be optimizing or
         not with the FIX and UNFIX commands.  That is, <tt>fix radius</tt>
         would make the radius variable non-optimizing (fixed value).
Also, the pdelta and pscale attributes may be accessed at runtime, as in
<pre>
height.pscale := 2*height.pscale
</pre>
 "Optimising_parameter" is a synonym.

The default value is 1. Synonym: spring_constant.

<hr>
<a name="symmetric_content"></a><h2>Symmetric content</h2>
The datafile keyword <tt>SYMMETRIC_CONTENT</tt> triggers the use of
an alternate surface integral for calculating body volumes,
namely the vectorfield (x,y,z)/3.  It is useful if unmodelled sides of a body are radial from the origin, or if constraint content
   integrals (which is evaluated by an approximation) lead
   to asymmetric results on what should be a symmetric surface.

<hr>
<a name="keep_originals"></a><h2>Keep original ids</h2>
The presence of the keyword
<pre>
keep_originals
</pre>
in the top of the datafile has the same effect as the -i command line

datafile, instead of renumbering them in the order they are read in.

If a datafile contains features present only after a certain version of
the Evolver, the datafile can contain a line of the form <br>

<em>k p1 [p2 ...] </em> BOUNDARY <em>b</em> [FIXED] [BARE] [<em>quantityname ...</em>] 
   [<em>methodname ...</em>] 
</pre>
          Here <em>k</em> is the vertex number, a positive integer.  Vertices
              do not need to be listed in order, and there may be gaps
              in the numbering.  However, if they are not in consecutive
              order, then the numbering in dump files will be different.
              <em>x y ...</em> are constant expressions 
              for coordinates.
              In the parametric boundary format, the boundary parameter
              values are given instead of the coordinates. 
           If <a href="elements.htm#fixed vertex"><tt>FIXED</tt></a> is given,
              then the vertex never moves, except possibly for an
              initial projection to constraints. If <tt>CONSTRAINT</tt> is 
              given, then one or more 
<a href="constrnt.htm#level set constraints">constraint</a> numbers must follow.
              You can list as many constraints as you
              want, as long as those that apply exactly at any time
	      are consistent and independent.
              The given coordinates need not lie exactly on the
              constraints; they will be projected onto them.  A vertex
              on a parametric boundary cannot also be on a constraint.
<p>
	      The  <a href="elements.htm#bare vertex"><tt>BARE</tt></a>
 attribute is just an instruction to the
	      checking routines that this vertex is not supposed to have
	      an adjacent facet in the soapfilm model, so spurious
	      warnings will not be generated.  This is useful when you
	      want to show bare wires or outline fundamental domains.
<p>An arbitrary number of 
<a href="quants.htm#named quantities">named quantities</a>
 or <a href="quants.htm#method instances">method instances</a> may
	      be listed.  These add method values for this element to the
	      named quantity.  The named quantity or instance
	      must have been
<a href="#named quantity decl">declared</a> in the top section of the datafile.

<a name="edges section"></a><h2>Edge list</h2>
              The datafile edge list follows the vertex list,
              and is started by the keyword <tt>EDGES</tt> at the 
              start of a line.  It is followed by lines with one
              edge specification per line in this format (linespliced here):
<pre>
<em>k v1 v2 [midv] [s1 s2 s3]</em> [WRAP <em>w</em>] [FIXED] [BOUNDARY <em>b</em>] \
   [CONSTRAINTS <em>c1 [c2 ...]</em>] [TENSION <em>constexpr</em>] [COLOR <em>n</em>] \
     [BARE]  [<em>quantityname ...</em>] [<em>methodname ...</em>] 
</pre>

Here <em>k</em> is the edge number, with numbering following the same
rules as for vertices.  <em>v1</em> and <em>v2</em> are the numbers of
the tail and head vertices of the edge.  In the 
<a href="model.htm#quadratic model">quadratic model</a>, the
edge midpoint may be listed as a third vertex <em>midv</em> (otherwise a
midpoint vertex will be created).  In the 
<a href="model.htm#torus model">torus model</a>, there must
follow signs <em>s1 s2 s3</em> indicating how the edge
wraps around each unit cell direction: + for once
positive, * for none, and - for once negative.  In non-torus
<a href="model.htm#symmetry groups">symmetry groups</a>, each edge 
should have a <tt>WRAP</tt> symmetry group element encoded as an integer.
<a href="elements.htm#fixed edge"><tt>FIXED</tt></a> means that
all vertices and edges resulting from subdividing this edge will have
the <tt>FIXED</tt> attribute; it does not mean that the
endpoints will be automatically fixed.  Likewise the  
<a href="constrnt.htm#parametric boundaries"><tt>BOUNDARY</tt></a> and 
<a href="constrnt.htm#level set constraints"><tt>CONSTRAINT</tt></a>
 attributes will be inherited by all edges and vertices
derived from this edge.  If a constraint has energy or content
integrands, these will be done for this edge.  IMPORTANT: If a
constraint number is given as negative, the edge energy and content
integrals will be done in the opposite orientation.  In the 
<a href="model.htm#string model">string model</a>, 
the default tension is 1, and in the 
<a href="model.htm#soapfilm model">soapfilm model</a>, the default
tension is 0.  However, edges may be given nonzero tension in the
soapfilm model, and they will contribute to the energy.
<p>
 If the <a href="model.htm#simplex model">simplex model</a>
 is in effect, edges are one less dimension
	      than facets and given by an ordered list of vertices. 
	      Only edges on constraints with integrals need be listed.
<p>
     The <a href="elements.htm#bare edge"><tt>BARE</tt></a>
 attribute is just an instruction to the
	      checking routines that this ede is not supposed to have
	      an adjacent facet in the soapfilm model, so spurious
	      warnings will not be generated.  This is useful when you
	      want to show bare wires or outline fundamental domains.

<p>An arbitrary number of 
<a href="quants.htm#named quantities">named quantities</a>
 or <a href="quants.htm#method instances">method instances</a> may
	      be listed.  These add method values for this element to the
	      must have been
<a href="#named quantity decl">declared</a> in the top section of the datafile. 
If the quantity or instance has orientation-dependent methods, the name
may be followed by a dash to reverse the applied orientation.

<h2>   Face list</h2>

       The datafile face list follows the edge list, 
       and is started by the keyword <tt>FACES</tt> at the 
       start of a line.  It is followed by lines with one
         facets specification per line in this format:
<pre>
  <em>k   e1 e2 ...</em>  [FIXED] [TENSION <em>constexpr</em>] [BOUNDARY <em>b</em>] \
  [CONSTRAINTS <em>c1 [c2 ...]</em>]     [NODISPLAY]   \
   [COLOR <em>n</em>]} [FRONTCOLOR <em>n</em>] [BACKCOLOR <em>n</em>] \
   [PHASE <em>n</em>] [<em>quantityname</em> ...] [<em>methodname</em> ...] 
</pre>
              Here <em>k</em> is the face number, with numbering following the 
              same rules as for 
<a href="#vertices section">vertices</a>. There follows a list of 
              oriented edge numbers in counterclockwise order around
              the face.  A negative edge number means the opposite
              orientation of the edge from that defined in the edge list.
              The head of the last edge must be the tail of the first
              edge (except if you're being tricky in the 
<a href="model.htm#string model">string model</a>).
              There is no limit on the number of edges.  The face
              will be automatically subdivided into triangles if it has 
              more than three edges in the 
<a href="model.htm#soapfilm model">soapfilm model</a>.
              The 
<a href="elements.htm#facet density"><tt>TENSION</tt></a>
 (synonym: <tt>DENSITY</tt>) 
value is the energy per unit area
              (the <a href="energies.htm#surface tension">surface tension</a>)
 of the facet; the default is 1.  Density 0 facets exert no
              force, and can be useful to define volumes or in
              displays.  Fractional density is useful for prescribed
              contact angles.
              <a href="elements.htm#nodisplay"><tt>NODISPLAY</tt></a>
prevents the facet from being displayed.
	      The  <a href="elements.htm#facet color"><tt>COLOR</tt></a>
 attribute applies to both sides of a facet;
	      <a href="elements.htm#frontcolor"><tt>FRONTCOLOR</tt></a>
 applies to the positive side (edges
	      going counterclockwise) and 
<a href="elements.htm#backcolor"><tt>BACKCOLOR</tt></a> to the 
	      negative side.
              The <a href="elements.htm#facet phase"><tt>PHASE</tt></a> 
number is used in the <a href="model.htm#string model">string model</a>
              to determine the surface tension of edges between facets
              of different phases, if phases are used.
<p>
              If the <a href="model.htm#simplex model">simplex model</a>
 is in effect, the edge list should
              be replaced by an oriented list of vertex numbers.

<p>An arbitrary number of 
<a href="quants.htm#named quantities">named quantities</a>
 or <a href="quants.htm#method instances">method instances</a> may
	      be listed.  These add method values for this element to the

If the quantity or instance has orientation-dependent methods, the name
may be followed by a dash to reverse the applied orientation.

<a name="bodies section"></a><h2> Body list</h2>

              The datafile body list follows the face list, and 
              is started by the keyword <tt>BODIES</tt> at the
              start of a line.  It is followed by lines with one
              body specification per line in this format:
<pre>
<em>k  f1 f2 f3 ....</em> [VOLUME <em>constexpr</em>] [VOLCONST <em>constexpr</em>] [ACTUAL_VOLUME <em>constexpr</em>] \
[PRESSURE <em>p</em>] [DENSITY <em>constexpr</em>] [PHASE <em></em>] 
</pre>

              Here <em>k</em> is the body number, 
              and <em>f1 f2 f3 ...</em> is an
              unordered list of signed facet numbers.  Positive
              sign indicates that the facet normal (as given by
              the right-hand rule from the edge order in the
              facet list) is outward from the body and negative means
              the normal is inward. Giving a 
              <tt>VOLUME</tt> value <em>constexpr</em> means the body has a 
<a href="elements.htm#target volume">volume constraint</a>,
              unless the
<a href="datafile.htm#ideal gas decl">ideal gas model</a>
 is in effect, in which case <em>constexpr</em>
              is the volume at the ambient pressure. 
              <a href="elements.htm#body volconst"><tt>VOLCONST</tt></a>
 is a value added to the volume; it is useful
              when the volume calculation from facet and edge integrals
              differs from the true volume by a constant amount, as may
	      happen in the <a href="model.htm#torus model">torus model</a>.
<tt>ACTUAL_VOLUME</tt> is a number that can be specified
	       in the rare circumstances where the torus volume
	      volconst calculation gives the wrong answer; volconst
					     will be adjusted to give this volume of the body.
              Giving a <tt>PRESSURE</tt> value means
              that the body is deemed to have a constant internal
              <a href="elements.htm#body pressure">pressure</a>;
 this is useful for prescribed mean
              curvature problems.  It is incompatible with
              prescribed volume.  Giving a 
<a href="elements.htm#body density"><tt>DENSITY</tt></a> value means
              that 
<a href="energies.htm#gravity energy">gravitational potential energy</a>
  will be included. 
<p>
              To endow a facet with <tt>VOLUME</tt>, <tt>PRESSURE</tt>, 
or <tt>DENSITY</tt>
         attributes in the <a href="model.htm#string model">string model</a>,
 define a body with just the one facet.
<p>
              The 
<a href="elements.htm#body phase"><tt>PHASE</tt></a>
 number is used in the <a href="model.htm#soapfilm model">soapfilm model</a>
    to determine the <a href="energies.htm#surface tension">surface tension</a>
 of facets between bodies of different phases, if phases are used.

<a name="read section"></a><h2> READ section</h2>
  The final section of the datafile may contain commands.
  These commands are read and executed immediately, just as
  if they had been entered at the command prompt.
       Encountering the keyword  <tt>READ</tt> in the datafile causes
       the Evolver to switch from datafile mode to command mode and
       read the rest of the datafile as command input.  This feature
       is useful for automatic initialization of the surface with
       refining, iteration, defining your own commands, etc.
        The <tt>READ</tt> section is optional.
Example:
<pre>  bodies
  1   1 2 3 4 5 6 volume 1

  read

  // automatically do this when datafile is loaded
  refine edge where on_constraint 1

  // typical evolution
