<a name="column example"></a> <h1>Example: Column of liquid solder</h1>


Here we have a tiny drop of liquid solder that bridges between two
parallel, horizontal planes at z = 0 and z = ZH. 
On each plane there is a circular pad
that the solder perfectly wets, and the solder is perfectly nonwetting
off the pads.  This would be just a catenoid problem with fixed volume,
except that the pads are offset, and it is desired to find out what
aligning force the solder exerts.  The surface is defined the same 
way as in the catenoid example, except the lower boundary ring has
a shift variable "<tt>SHIFT</tt>" in it to provide an offset in the 
y direction.
This makes the shift adjustable at run time.  
Since the top and bottom
facets of the body are not included, the constant volume they account
for is provided by content integrals around the upper
boundary, and the gravitational energy is provided by an energy
integral.
One could use the volconst attribute of the body instead for the volume,
but then one would have to reset that every time <tt>ZH</tt> changed.
<p>

The interesting part of this example is the calculation of the 
forces. One could incrementally shift the pad, minimize the
energy at each shift,
and numerically differentiate the energy to get the force.  Or one could
set up integrals to calculate the force directly.  But the simplest method
is to use the Principle of Virtual Work by shifting the pad, recalculating
the energy without re-evolving, and correcting for the volume change.
Re-evolution is not necessary because when a surface is at an equilibrium,
then by definition any perturbation that respects constraints does not
change the energy to first order.  To adjust for changes in constraints
such as volume, the Lagrange multipliers (pressure for the volume constraint)
tell how much the energy changes for given change in the constraints:
<pre>          DE = L*DC
</pre>
where DE is the energy change,
L is the row vector of Lagrange multipliers and DC is the column
vector of constraint value changes.  Therefore, the adjusted energy
after a change in a parameter is
<pre>          E_adj = E_raw - L*DC
</pre>
where E_raw is the actual energy and DC is the vector of differences of
constraint values from target values.  The commands do_yforce and
do_zforce in the datafile do central difference calculations of the
forces on the top pad, and put the surface back to where it was
originally.  Note that the perturbations are made smoothly, i.e. the
shear varies linearly from bottom to top.  This is not absolutely
necessary, but it gives a smoother perturbation and hence
a bit more accuracy.
