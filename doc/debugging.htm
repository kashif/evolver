<h1>Surface Evolver Debugging</h1>

There are several debugging features built into Evolver. Script 
debugging is meant for ordinary users; the others are meant mostly
for Evolver developers (me).

<a name="script debugging"><h2>Script Debugging</h2></a>

A 'script' here refers to any Evolver commands, whether
they be in procedures or functions.
<p>
Debugging may be done the old-fashioned way, by putting print
statments in code.  Another alternative is to put
<a href="commands.htm#subcommand"><tt>subcommand</tt></a> in a script
to let the user explore the state of the surface at a given 
point in a script.  If you can't or don't want to modify
the script, then you can set breakpoints.

<h3> <a name="breakpoints">Breakpoints</a></h3>
The user may set a breakpoint in an already loaded script
with the "set breakpoint" command.  The syntax is 
<pre>
  BREAKPOINT <em>scriptname</em> <em>linenumber</em>
</pre>
where <em>scriptname</em> is the name of the function or
procedure and <em>linenumber</em> is the line number in 
the file where the breakpoint is to be set. There must be
executable code on the line, or you will get an error.
<em>linenumber</em> may be an expression.
<p>
Breakpoints may be unset individually with
<pre>
  UNSET BREAKPOINT <em>scriptname</em> <em>linenumber</em>
</pre>
or as a group with
<pre>
  UNSET BREAKPOINTS 
</pre>
<p>
When a breakpoint is reached, Evolver will enter into a subcommand prompt,
at which the user may enter any Evolver commands (although some commands,
such as <tt>load</tt> would be very unwise).  
To exit from the
subcommand prompt, use <tt>q</tt> or <tt>exit</tt> or <tt>quit</tt>.
<p>
<a name="single-stepping"></a>
<b>Single-stepping:</b> At the debug prompt, there is a special
single-step command <tt>n</tt>. which will continue execution to the next line
(to be precise, until the line number changes).  

<p>
<a name="stack trace"></a> <a name="whereami"></a>
<b>Stack trace:</b> At the debug prompt, the <tt>whereami</tt> command
 will print
 a stack trace, showing the sequence of function or procedure calls made to
reach the current spot.


<hr>
<a name="syntax debugging"><h2>Syntax Debugging</h2></a>
The error messages produced by Evolver's command parser try to
be helpful, but sometimes are rather cryptic.  Frequent errors
are misspelled keywords, variables that are spelled the same
as keywords, use of uninitialized variables,
 and missing semicolons.  Check these before trying
any fancy syntax debugging as described here. It is possible to
print out the parsing steps, but this is not for the faint of heart,
since it the printout is in very unfriendly YACC format. You will
have to have an understanding of how shift-reduce parsing works
to have a chance at understanding the output.  The
toggle <tt>debug</tt> controls the YACC trace feature.
Example:
<pre>

Enter command: debug
YACC debugging was OFF.
Now ON.
Enter command: print asdf
Starting parse
Entering state 0
Reading a token: Next token is token COMMAND_START_ ()
Shifting token COMMAND_START_ ()
Entering state 2
Reading a token: Next token is token PRINT_ ()
Reducing stack by rule 2 (line 158), -> @1

Shifting token NEWIDENT_ ()
Entering state 11
Reading a token: Now at end of input.
syntax error

Shifting token error ()
Entering state 316
Reducing stack by rule 391 (line 1295), NEWIDENT_ error -> rexpr
ERROR 2381: Syntax error: Unexpected new identifier 'asdf'.
  Input line so far:

</pre>


<hr>
<a name="memory debugging"><h2>Memory Debugging</h2></a>
The <tt><a href="single.htm#c">c</a></tt> command gives a brief printout of
memory usage, including element memory as calculated for the 
number of existing elements, and total allocated data memory.
 For example, on Windows:
<pre>

Enter command:  c
Vertices: 50  Edges: 144  Facets: 96  Bodies: 1  Facetedges: 288
Element memory: 40280
Total data memory: 302122 bytes.
</pre>
If the <tt>verbose</tt> toggle is on, then more detailed information
(which may depend on your system) is printed:
<pre>

Enter command: verbose
Verbose ON. (was off)
Enter command: c
Vertices: 50  Edges: 144  Facets: 96  Bodies: 1  Facetedges: 288
Element memory: 40280
    vertex size:  152 bytes;  number allocated: 156
      edge size:   80 bytes;  number allocated: 244
     facet size:   96 bytes;  number allocated: 196
      body size:  424 bytes;  number allocated: 154
 facetedge size:   40 bytes;  number allocated: 388
quantity size:    360 bytes
instance size:    656 bytes

blocks in use: 181    memory in use: 360740
blocks free:    16    memory free:    45080
Heap top: 03477000
Heap size: 48.71 MB
Physical memory size: 1072680960 bytes   Virtual memory top: 7FFE0000
Session:       4 blocks,      11200 bytes
Permanent:    77 blocks,     290922 bytes
Temporary:     0 blocks,          0 bytes
Total data memory: 81 blocks, 302122 bytes.
</pre>

<p>


<b>For gurus only.</b> The <a href="toggle.htm#memdebug">memdebug</a>
command causes verbose information to be printed at every memory allocation,
reallocation, or deallocation.   Meant for me to use debugging Evolver itself.
If Evolver was compiled with MEMSTRINGS defined, then the file and line
location of each memory operation is also printed.
It also causes heap checking
to be done on some systems at each memory operation.

<hr>
<a name="gradient debugging"><h2>Gradient Debugging</h2></a>

<b>For gurus mostly.</b>
The <a href="toggle.htm#estimate"><tt>estimate</tt></a> toggle can be used
to verify that gradients are being calculated correctly.
When on, <tt>estimate</tt> will, for each 'g' step, print
the energy change based on the gradient, that is, calculate the
inner product of the velocity and energy gradient at each vertex
and sum the products, and then also pring the actual energy 
change during the motion.  For small scales, these numbers should be
very close, since energy should change nearly linearly over
short scales.  For example,
<pre>
Enter command: estimate
Estimation ON. (was off)
Enter command: m 1e-6
Scale fixed at 1e-006.
Enter command: g 2
Estimated energy change: -9.16981132075472e-006
Actual energy change   : -9.16979039722321e-006
  2. area:  5.99999083020960 energy:  5.99999083020960  scale: 1.00000e-006
Estimated energy change: -9.16972762183562e-006
Actual energy change   : -9.16970669440076e-006
  1. area:  5.99998166050291 energy:  5.99998166050291  scale: 1.00000e-006
</pre>

However, if volume constraints or quantity constraints are not satisfied,
then it may take a few iterations for agreement to be reached:
<pre>

Enter command: body[1].target := 2
Enter command: estimate
Estimation ON. (was off)
Enter command: m 1e-6
Scale fixed at 1e-006.
Enter command: g 5
Estimated energy change: -1.20000000000000e-005
Actual energy change   :     2.74061897546020
  5. area:  8.74061897546020 energy:  8.74061897546020  scale: 1.00000e-006

Estimated energy change: -8.05945861736465e-006
Actual energy change   : -8.06006082854083e-006
  3. area:  8.74050383525465 energy:  8.74050383525465  scale: 1.00000e-006
Estimated energy change: -8.05934708554515e-006
Actual energy change   : -8.05931920133673e-006
  2. area:  8.74049577593545 energy:  8.74049577593545  scale: 1.00000e-006
Estimated energy change: -8.05923555500071e-006
Actual energy change   : -8.05920767277257e-006
  1. area:  8.74048771672778 energy:  8.74048771672778  scale: 1.00000e-006
Enter command:
</pre>

<p>
For optimizing scale, when evolution is well behaved, the estimate will
be around twice the actual change, since this is the ratio for a
perfectly quadratic energy function.  Example:
<pre>
Enter command: estimate
Estimation ON. (was off)
Enter command: g 5
Estimated energy change:    -1.23332147258421
Actual energy change   :   -0.647118913175537
  5. area:  5.35288108682446 energy:  5.35288108682446  scale: 0.233721
Estimated energy change:   -0.420072251955455
Actual energy change   :   -0.203503019926857
  4. area:  5.14937806689761 energy:  5.14937806689761  scale: 0.212928
Estimated energy change:   -0.219347968060792

  3. area:  5.04077073041990 energy:  5.04077073041990  scale: 0.197501
Estimated energy change:   -0.130401658330236
Actual energy change   :  -0.0647701891524211
  2. area:  4.97600054126748 energy:  4.97600054126748  scale: 0.213378
Estimated energy change:  -0.0809651401128813
Actual energy change   :  -0.0401832076359208
  1. area:  4.93581733363156 energy:  4.93581733363156  scale: 0.198322
Enter command:
</pre>
<p>
Beware that non-smooth evolution, for example with one-sided
constraints, can invalidate the assumptions behind <tt>estimate</tt>.


<hr>
<a name="hessian debugging"><h2>Hessian Debugging</h2></a>

The <a href="toggle.htm#hessian_quiet">hessian_quiet</a> toggle
can be turned off to print information on memory usage and 
workload during Hessian factoring (hessian, hessian_seek, ritz,
eigenprobe commands).  For example,
<pre>

Enter command: hessian_quiet off
Enter command: eigenprobe 0
Sparse init alloc: 36897
Expanded hashtable size: 73794.
Expanded hashtable size: 147588.
Sparse entries: 61444  Final hashtable size: 147588
Hash extra probes: 256957
Variables: 12291  Original fill: 61446
Workspace: 8 bytes
Passes through main loop: 34
Total_fill:  538907
Total_flops: 7.25226e+007
Eigencounts:    3 <,  0 ==,  12286 >
</pre>
There are some differences in output depending on whether
the ysmp toggle is on (using the Yale Sparse Matrix Package) or off
(using my home-grown minimal degree algorithm).
<p>
<b>For gurus only.</b>
Evolver has a feature that permits numerical checking of the 
correctness of the named-quantity Hessian-calculating routines.  The
<a href="toggle.htm#hessian_diff">hessian_diff</a> toggle causes
Hessians to be calculated with finite differences of gradients
rather than the routines in question.  
  There are some limitations on what
kinds of surfaces the numerical Hessian works on, primarily
it won't work with volume or quantity constraints.  But since
any quantity can be tested as an energy, that does not affect
its main purpose.

<a name="iteration debugging"><h2>Iteration Debugging</h2></a>
The <a href="toggle.htm#itdebug">itdebug</a> command toggles the printing
of information during a '<a href="single.htm#g">g</a>' command.
It prints the scale factor for the move, the progress in convergence
of the volume or fixed quantity constraints (in terms of the total
error as a multiple of the tolerance), then the energy and volumes
resulting from the move.  An example using cube.fe with optimizing scale:
