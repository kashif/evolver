Version 2.01
  Surface Evolver version 2.01 is now available at
  http://www.geom.umn.edu/locate/evolver
  or by anonymous ftp from geom.umn.edu in /pub/software/evolver.
  This version is mostly bug fixes, but with a couple new features
  as listed below.

  There are new Mac 68K and Power PC versions in Evolver68K.sea.Hqx
  and EvolverPPC.sea.Hqx, respectively.  This is the first native
  Power PC version, and the first 68K update in a year.

New features and changes

  There is a new no_refine attribute for edges and facets.  It
  prevents edges from being subdivided by the 'r' command.
  Useful for large flat fixed surfaces or outlines.

  You can create new elements on the fly with new_vertex, new_edge,
  new_face, and new_body.  

  The V command has been tweaked to work better on constrained vertices.
  Also, there is a new command vertex_average to do individual
  vertex averaging on the vertices of your choice.

  Command output can be appended to a file using the &gt;&gt; redirection
  symbol, as in    { g 100; u; g 20 } &gt;&gt; "logfile"

  Equiangulation has been implemented for surfaces made of 3D
  simplices.

  The knot_energy method now uses "node_charge" vertex attribute
  for calculating its electrostatic-type energy.  Useful for
  spreading network graphs out in 3D.

  There is an experimental implementation dynamic link libraries for 
  functions used in constraints, boundaries, integrands, etc.
  This can replace interpreted functions with compiled functions
  for greater speed.
 
  DOS, Windows versions leaves alphanumeric escape sequences alone
  in quoted strings, so path names don't get mangled.
  
  The variables transform_expr and transform_count can be printed,
  so you can see the current state if you are using multiple
  image transforms.

Tetrahedralization.

  Some users are interested in constructing tetrahedral meshes
  of the inside of an Evolver surface, e.g. for doing stress
  analysis on solidified solder.  I've put together a set of
  programs that does this, which those interested may get by
  anonymous ftp from geom.umn.edu as /priv/brakke/tetra.tar.
